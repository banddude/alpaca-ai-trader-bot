# AI-Powered Trading Bot

## ‚ö° TL;DR
This trading bot combines the power of OpenAI's intelligence with Alpaca's trading capabilities and yfinance's market data. Once configured with your API keys, the bot can run in three modes:
- **Auto Mode**: Automatically analyzes your portfolio and watchlist stocks, makes trading decisions, and executes them
- **Manual Mode**: Same analysis but asks for your confirmation before each trade
- **Demo Mode**: Simulates trades without actually executing them

The bot uses yfinance to fetch real-time market data and calculate moving averages, OpenAI to make intelligent trading decisions, and Alpaca's API to execute trades.
